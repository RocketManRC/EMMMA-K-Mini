# Example for Garageband MacOS

The zip file contains a Garageband project that includes a backing track of a slow blues song (Going Down Slow) and three instrument tracks that go well with it. This project is only compatible with Garageband version 10.4.12 or newer however. 

For an earlier version of Garageband start a new project and create an audio track with the file 'Going Down Slow (blues) Backing Track.mp3'. Suitable instruments are the standard Rock Organ, Saxaphone and Saturn Lead.

The song is in the key of C and a good scale for the EMMMA-K is Minor Pentatonic.

The file 'Going Down Slow (blues) Jam.mp3' is a jam session using the Rock Organ instrument.
