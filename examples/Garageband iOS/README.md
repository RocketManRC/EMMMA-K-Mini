# Example for Garageband iOS

The zip file contains a Garageband project for iOS that includes a backing track of a slow blues song (Going Down Slow) and an instrument track that goes pretty well with it. This project is compatible with Garageband version 2.3.16 or newer and iOS version 17 or newer.

The song is in the key of C and a good scale for the EMMMA-K is Minor Pentatonic.
