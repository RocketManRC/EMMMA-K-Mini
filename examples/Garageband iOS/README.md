# Example for Garageband iOS

The zip file contains a Garageband project for iOS that includes a backing track of a slow blues song (Going Down Slow) and a built-in instrument track that goes pretty well with it. This project is compatible with Garageband version 2.3.16 or newer and iOS version 17 or newer.

The song is in the key of C and a good scale for the EMMMA-K is Minor Pentatonic.

To get this on your iPad or iPhone:
- Touch the zip file which and then touch the download icon (on iOS 17 you will see "Unable to view file" first so choose "Open in Browser" and then the download icon).
- With the Files app go to the Downloads folder and touch the zip file that was downloaded. This should unzip it and create the ,band file.
- You probably want to move the file to the On My iPad location and the GarageBand for iOS folder so that GarageBand will find it without you having to search for it.
